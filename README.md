## Abstract
In this project you will use OpenGL to create realtime pipeline-based graphics. In particular, you will add some functionality to the code from ![Tutorial 06](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-6-keyboard-and-mouse/) of ![opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/).

Tutorials 01 through 06 explain how to create an OpenGL program that displays a cube, with numbers displayed on each face through textures. The cube is fixed at the origin, and keyboard controls and mouse input can move the camera to different vantage points.

## Assignment
* Modify this program to display two cubes instead of just one
* Add keyboard controls for the second cube
### My Work After Assignment Due Date
* Added separate keyboard controls for the first cube
* Modified camera to look around the scene using mouse cursor
